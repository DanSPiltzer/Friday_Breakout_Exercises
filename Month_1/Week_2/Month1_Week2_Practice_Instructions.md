## Instructions
- Read in the csv as a dataframe
- Create a graph that shows how many calls, orders, and green attachments were made each day using ggplot2
	- *hint*: use dplyr and tidyr to clean your data set before graphing
- Save your code and the graph in an RMarkdown file and store it, as well as the raw csv, and a README.md in a new github repo
